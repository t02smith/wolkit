	abstract = {In this paper we present an approach based on the use of embedded network devices for the deployment of small network services, such as {DHCP}, {BOOTP}, filters or very specific proxies. The novelty of the proposal resides in the very reduced size of the devices, in that every device is specialized in a certain network function, and specially designed to operate with minimum maintenance, and in the fact that they are presented under both conventional (client-server) and more open ({SOA}) standards, more concretely, as Web services. At the same time, these embedded services can work in an individual way or in collaboration with other enterprise network services, either provided by means of conventional systems or by means of other embedded devices. To specify the proposal, we have chosen as example an embedded device able to manage the remote boot of network nodes by means of wake on {LAN} ({WoL}) through Internet.},

	abstract = {Mobile communication technologies such as Bluetooth are becoming ubiquitous, but they must provide satisfactory levels of security and privacy. Concerns about Bluetooth device security have led the speciﬁcation of the “non-discoverable” mode, which prevents devices from being listed during a Bluetooth device search process. However, a nondiscoverable Bluetooth device is visible to devices that know its address or can discover its address. This paper discusses the detection of non-discoverable Bluetooth devices using an enhanced brute force search attack. Our results indicate that the average time to attack a non-discoverable Bluetooth device using multiple search devices and condensed packet timing can be reduced to well under 24 hours.},
