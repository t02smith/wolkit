\section{Introduction}

This project will look at how the Wake-on-LAN (WoL) standard can be implemented into home networks to improve accessibility and reduce power consumption of devices.

Some of the example use-cases of this project include:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item managing a home network of devices that consists of personal and IoT devices,
  \item accessing devices in hard to reach locations, and
  \item scheduling devices to wake and perform specific actions.
\end{itemize}

By only having devices on when they are in-use, this project aims to massively reduce the amount of power wasted everyday by idle devices.
