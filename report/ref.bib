	abstract = {In this paper we present an approach based on the use of embedded network devices for the deployment of small network services, such as {DHCP}, {BOOTP}, filters or very specific proxies. The novelty of the proposal resides in the very reduced size of the devices, in that every device is specialized in a certain network function, and specially designed to operate with minimum maintenance, and in the fact that they are presented under both conventional (client-server) and more open ({SOA}) standards, more concretely, as Web services. At the same time, these embedded services can work in an individual way or in collaboration with other enterprise network services, either provided by means of conventional systems or by means of other embedded devices. To specify the proposal, we have chosen as example an embedded device able to manage the remote boot of network nodes by means of wake on {LAN} ({WoL}) through Internet.},

This paper presents a comprehensive survey on energy conserving issues and solutions in using diverse wireless radio access technologies for {IoT} connectivity, e.g., the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) machine type communications, {IEEE} 802.11ah, Bluetooth Low Energy ({BLE}), and Z-Wave. We look into the literature in broad areas of standardization, academic research, and industry development, and structurally summarize the energy conserving solutions based on several technical criteria. We also propose future research directions regarding energy conserving issues in wireless networking-based {IoT}.},

To realize the proposed room architecture, we proposed and designed the automatic standby power cut-off outlet and a {ZigBee} controller with {IR} code learning functionality. The proposed power outlet monitors the power consumption for the predetermined time and completely cuts off the power supply when the monitored power is below the threshold. This power outlet has a function of changing the threshold power, which enables any kinds of home appliances to be applied to the power outlet. To efficiently manage the power outlets and the lights, we proposed the {ZigBee} controller with {IR} code learning functionality. The {ZigBee} controller has several onboard buttons to wake up the power outlets and control the dimming light. By using {IR} code learning functionality, the {ZigBee} controller can assign a certain {IR} code of a remote control of a home appliance to the power outlet or the dimming light. A user can control the power outlets and the dimming light with an {IR} remote control of any home appliance. Our proposed room architecture provides the remote-controllable and energy-saving room.},

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication using wireless {LAN} (Local Area Network) has issues. Fast Device Discovery is one of them. In this paper, we proposed two novel methods to solve this issue. The methods are Collective Scanning and Collective Scanning + Extension Receiving. Collective Scanning improves the scanning time by a vehicle which operates in one channel receives responses from all pedestrians which operate in available channels. Collective Scanning + Extension Receiving, is an extension method of Collective Scanning, improves the scanning time and prevents the detection leakage of pedestrians by a vehicle that extends waiting of responses depending on the number of responses from pedestrians. We evaluated two proposal methods compared with conventional Active Scanning of {IEEE} 802.11 about the scanning time and the detection rate of pedestrians using Network Simulator-3 ({NS}-3). In the result, by Collective Scanning, the scanning time improved 24.51 millisecond (ms) from 114.74 ms with the same detection rate in the environment that has one vehicle and within 50 pedestrians when comparing with Active Scanning of {IEEE} 802.11. By Collective Scanning + Extension Receiving, the scanning time improved 42.52 ms from 114.65 ms with the same detection rate in the environment that has one vehicle and more than 50 pedestrians when comparing with Active Scanning of {IEEE} 802.11.},

The performance of this process is the result of a complex interaction between several devices, some of which exhibit random behaviour. We use probabilistic model checking and, in particular, the tool {PRISM} to compute the best- and worst-case performance of device discovery: the expected time for the process to complete and the expected power consumption. We illustrate the utility of performing an exhaustive, low-level analysis to produce exact results in contrast to simulation techniques, where additional probabilistic assumptions must be made. We demonstrate an example of how seemingly innocuous assumptions can lead to incorrect performance estimations. We also analyse the effectiveness of improvements made between versions 1.1 and 1.2 of the Bluetooth specification.},

This technology makes it possible for a large number of devices to be connected to the Internet of Things. The {BLE} mechanism is clearly defined by the standard, however, there is room for improvements in some aspects of the technology such as the discovery process. Although the discovery process of traditional Bluetooth architecture has been intensively investigated through analytical and simulation models over the years, it cannot be applied to the {BLE} technology because of many changes introduced in the design of the {BLE}. Recently, there have been several works for performance evaluation of {BLE} discovery process, but they are not still thorough enough in providing a holistic analysis of the {BLE}. This has motivated our study for more accurate modeling of the {BLE} discovery process. Our work focuses on developing an analytical model and carrying out intensive simulations to investigate discovery probability and quantitative examination of the influence of parameter settings on the discovery latency and the energy performance metric of the discovery process.},

	abstract = {Device discovery and connection establishment are fundamental to communication between two Bluetooth ({BT}) devices. In this paper, we give an analytical model of the time it takes for the master in a piconet to discover one slave. We show that, even in the absence of packet interference, the discovery time can be long in some instances. We have simulated the discovery protocol by actually implementing it to validate the analytical model. By means of simulations, we show how discovery time is affected by (i) the presence of multiple potential slaves, and (ii) changes in the maximum backoff limit. Using simulation studies we observed the effectiveness of two proposed improvements to device discovery, namely, (i) avoiding repetitions of the A and B trains before a train switch, and (ii) eliminating the idea of random backoff, or reducing the backoff limit. We show that discovery time can be reduced by avoiding repetitions of the A and B trains before a train switch. However, complete elimination of the random backoff is not a good idea, as discovery time will be too long when the number of {BT} devices is large. Instead, choosing a small backoff limit of 250–300 slots is highly effective in reducing discovery time even in the presence of a large number (say, 50) of potential slaves.},
