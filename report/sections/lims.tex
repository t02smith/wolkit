\section{Limitations}

Some of the limitations found from this project include:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item devices cannot be remotely turned off through the application and instead rely on the user being able to turn it off themselves,
    \item Wake-on-LAN has no delivery confirmation so my application includes no method for users to verify whether a device was woken; instead it is up to the user to find out themselves, and
    \item The environment sensors used for this application are tightly coupled to a specific piece of hardware for a Raspberry Pi.
\end{itemize}
